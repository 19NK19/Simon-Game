# Simon-Game is an Digital Verson of Simon is an electronic game of short-term memory skill invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison,
The Game has four colored buttons(Boxs), each producing a particular tone when it is pressed or activated by the Mouse . A round in the game consists of the Boxs lighting up one or more buttons in a random order, 
after which the player must reproduce that order by pressing the buttons. As the game progresses, 
the number of buttons to be pressed increases.
Simon's tones, on the other hand, were designed to always be harmonic,[2] no matter the sequence, and consisted of an A major triad in second inversion, resembling a trumpet fanfare:

E (blue, lower right);
C♯ (yellow, lower left);
A (red, upper right).
E (green, upper left, an octave lower than blue);
Some of the original 1978 models used an alternative set of tones, forming the B♭ minor triad:[10]

B♭ (blue, lower right);
C♯ (yellow, lower left);
F (red, upper right).
B♭ (green, upper left, an octave higher than blue);
